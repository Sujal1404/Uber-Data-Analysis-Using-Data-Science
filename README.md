# Uber-Data-Analysis-Using-Data-Science

Problem Statement:
Uber, being a large ride-sharing platform, generates massive amounts of data daily. Understanding trends and patterns in this data can help in identifying peak demand areas, high traffic times, under-served zones, and potential business bottlenecks.  The challenge is to process, clean, and analyze this raw data to uncover insights and actionable intelligence.

Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to analyze Uber ride data to extract meaningful insights about user behavior, ride frequency, peak hours, geographical trends, and operational performance. Using data science techniques, we aim to support decision-making processes for improving service efficiency, optimizing driver allocation, and enhancing customer experience.

Technologies & Tools Used:

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Folium

Data Visualization Tools: Tableau / Power BI (optional)

Jupyter Notebook for experimentation and reporting

📁 Dataset Used:
Uber ride data (e.g., April–September 2014 from NYC, available on Kaggle or official Uber releases)

Fields include: Date/Time, Lat, Lon, Base, etc.

🧼 Data Preprocessing Steps:
Load and merge data from multiple months.

Handle missing or inconsistent values.

Convert date/time columns to appropriate formats.

Create new features like:

Hour, Day, Month, Weekday

Ride Count

Location Clusters

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Temporal Analysis:

Number of trips per hour/day/month

Weekly trends and seasonal peaks

Spatial Analysis:

Heatmaps of ride locations

Clustering of pick-up points using K-Means

Base Analysis:

Ride count by base location

Most active bases by time of day

📈 Key Insights & Findings:
Identification of peak hours and days for Uber rides

Most active pickup locations in NYC

Demand forecasting based on historical ride patterns

Recommendations on driver reallocation and service expansion

📌 Outcomes / Deliverables:
A complete Jupyter Notebook with code, visualizations, and narrative analysis

A presentation/report summarizing findings

Optional interactive dashboard (Tableau/Power BI/Folium map)

💡 Future Work / Enhancements:
Incorporate weather data or traffic data to improve predictions

Apply machine learning models to forecast ride demand

Extend analysis to include user behavior or pricing models

👤 Target Audience:
Uber operations team

Data science enthusiasts

Business analysts

Urban planners and transportation researchers
